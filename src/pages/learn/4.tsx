        <br />
        <p>
          Conviction Voting is the governance system in which Commons Members
          create proposals to request funds from the Common Pool.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          TEC tokens can be staked on these proposals to signal approval of the
          request. Staked tokens accrue voting power, or Conviction,
          continuously over time. The amount of tokens currently voting on all
          proposals in Conviction Voting is represented by the term{' '}
          <strong>Effective Supply</strong>. The logarithmic function that
          decides the rate at which Conviction accumulates is{' '}
          <strong>Conviction Growth</strong>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This is the real power behind the TEC token. TEC holders have a direct
          impact on funding Token Engineering by reviewing projects and voting
          on which initiatives get funded and how much funding they receive.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The <strong>Spending Limit</strong> sets the maximum percentage of the
          Common Pool funds that can be requested by a single proposal. The{' '}
          <strong>Minimum Conviction</strong> dictates how many TEC tokens are
          needed to pass a proposal, no matter how small the amount requested.
        </p>
